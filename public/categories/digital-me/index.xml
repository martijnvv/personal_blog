      <description>Why I moved my personal blog from Wordpress to HugoIt was one of those rare moments in my freelance career when I had some extra time on my hands. Eager to work on a website and tinker with some code. I was looking at my personal website (which you’re on right now). It was still built on Wordpress, with a basic theme and some useful features. In reality, I wasn’t using much of the power that Wordpress holds.</description>

Analyse Google Location data with RGoogle is happily tracking my every move, thanks to my Android Samsung phone and poor privacy setting skills. Google collects my data about my movement through their location tracker. A lot of data!
In this blog I will explore the location data Google has collected about me since 2016.</description>

Getting my IMDB ratings with R and RvestI’m a big fan of IMDB and have been for many years. It is a fantastic website with a lot of information about movies, documentaries and tv-series. Besides fact-checking (“who was that guy playing in that one movie?”) it is also a place for me to collect all the ratings I have done on movies in the past few years.</description>

      <description>Meet the digital meThis is likely the most self-centered blogpost you will read today, maybe even this year. Because this post is all about me, the digital me.
Just like all people these days, I leave a digital footprint. I use apps, digital services and websites to share my experiences with others, keep people posted of what I do and compare what I do with all the stuff other people do.</description>
