      <description>Meet the digital meThis is likely the most self-centered blogpost you will read today, maybe even this year. Because this post is all about me, the digital me.
Just like all people these days, I leave a digital footprint. I use apps, digital services and websites to share my experiences with others, keep people posted of what I do and compare what I do with all the stuff other people do.</description>
