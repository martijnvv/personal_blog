      <description>Updates to Google Consent Management In March 2024, a new European privacy regulation will be implemented. This will have an impact on how we collect and process data.
Why is this important?
A new European regulation (Digital Markets Act) requires big tech to protect its users. They are responsible for respecting and collecting user consent As a result, we need to update our way of collecting data in GTM to &amp;ldquo;Consent Mode v2&amp;rdquo; All Google Advertising tracking will go through GA4 Consent Management will look different in GTM, as a result of the update If we don&amp;rsquo;t use this new technique, we cannot effectively use Google advertising products, starting march 2024 Coincidentally, Google Chrome will stop accepting 3rd party cookies end of March 2024 too, which means the urgency to shift is even higher What do we need to do to migrate?</description>

      <description>Understanding Composable CDP’s One of the new hot topics in tech is the “Composable CDP.” Databricks is sharing a good definition of a Composable CDP in their article written together with Hightouch and Snowplow Analytics.
“A Composable CDP consists of the same components as their off-the-shelf counterparts; Data Collection, Data Storage and Modeling, and Data Activation. By implementing a best-in-class product at each layer of the Composable CDP, organizations can achieve a far more extensible CDP solution that can solve problems well beyond the common use cases of off-the-shelf CDPs.</description>

      <description>Create Google Tag Manager documentation with RCreating digital data documentation can be a painstaking, boring, but extremely useful endeavor. Knowing what digital data is available to you and others can be helpful to understand the potential of your data set, as well as provide context to analysis, reporting and other ways to leverage data.
To take some of the effort out of creating documentation about the contents of your Google Tag Manager account, I have created a script that pulls data out of the environment and outputs a simple Excel file, which you can share with stakeholders.</description>
