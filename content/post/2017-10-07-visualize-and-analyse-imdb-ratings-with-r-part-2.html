<h1>Visualize and analyse IMDB ratings with R (part 2)</h1>
<p><em>This post is part of a series of posts to <a href="/meet-the-digital-me/">analyse the digital me</a>.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="/visualize-and-analyse-imdb-ratings-with-r/">my previous post about analysing IMDB ratings</a> in this series I explored some of the data I collected about my movie preferences, also compared to the ratings other IMDB raters.</p>
<p>In this post I will dig a little deeper to learn more about my own personal movie preferences.</p>
<div id="does-popularity-of-a-movie-impact-my-rating" class="section level2">
<h2>Does popularity of a movie impact my rating?</h2>
<p>Some movies are very mainstream, other are more niche or an “acquired” taste. The popularity of a movie can be determined in IMDB by the number of reviews a movie has received. Let’s first see how the number of IMDB reviews relates to the average IMDB rating. We can do that by building a sctaterplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>theme_data &lt;- theme_light(base_size = 13) + theme(plot.margin=unit(c(0.5,1,1.5,1.2),&quot;cm&quot;)) 
color_bar &lt;- &quot;#999999&quot;
color_fill &lt;- &quot;#5c85d6&quot;
#spread of movie release decades
ggplot(data_imdb, aes(x = imdb_ratings, y = imdb_rating)) +
  geom_point() +
  #scale_x_discrete(limit = c(1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) + 
  scale_y_discrete(limit = c(3:10)) + 
  ylab(&quot;IMDB average rating&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;Number of IMDB ratings&quot;) +   
  theme_data</code></pre>

<p>In this scatterplot you can see that most of the movies are clustered around a low number of reviews and are receiving average ratings between 6 and 7. It’s interesting to see that the movies with most IMDB ratings are all highly rated. Let’s check out which movies these are.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(arrange(data_imdb[,c(&quot;title&quot;, &quot;imdb_ratings&quot;, &quot;imdb_rating&quot;)],desc(imdb_ratings)),10)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                                                title imdb_ratings imdb_rating
## 1                           The Shawshank Redemption      2000322         9.3
## 2                                    The Dark Knight      1969523         9.0
## 3                                          Inception      1750193         8.8
## 4                                         Fight Club      1600985         8.8
## 5                                       Pulp Fiction      1565763         8.9
## 6                                       Forrest Gump      1522234         8.8
## 7  The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring      1441273         8.8
## 8                                         The Matrix      1435239         8.7
## 9      The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King      1424377         8.9
## 10                                     The Godfather      1370383         9.2</code></pre>
<p>So Shawshank Redemption and Dark Knight are the most reviewed movies I have rated myself. And they are both highly rated.</p>
<div id="understanding-the-probability-of-number-of-ratings-to-impact-my-rating" class="section level3">
<h3>Understanding the probability of number of ratings to impact my rating</h3>
<p>The probability can be calculated with a p-value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor(as.numeric(data_imdb$imdb_ratings), as.numeric(data_imdb$myRating))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.4478298</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the p-value is 0.4478298. This means that the number of ratings on IMDB will have a 45% chance of having no effect on my own rating. So there is a pretty high probability that the number of ratings will have an effect on my rating (52%).</p>

<div id="my-favorite-actors" class="section level2">
<h2>My favorite actors</h2>
<p>I always think I know which actors I like and put their movies on the top of my watchlist. Let’s check out if I actually rate the movies my favorite actors with the highest scores too.</p>
<p>For each movies I rate, there are a maximum of 15 actors added to the dataset. I have added them all to one column, pipe separated. I will use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html">data.table</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html">stringr</a> package to split the data in the cast column and learn more about the actors in the movies I reviewed. I will create a new dataframe with a count of the the actors (unique_actor_count) and find out how many actors are in this dataframe (unique_actors). After that, I will create a new dataframe with my top 10 most watched actors and visualise it in a barchart for easy interpretation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;data.table&#39;)
library(&#39;stringr&#39;)
as.character(data_imdb$imdb_cast) -&gt; data_imdb$imdb_cast
data.frame(table(unlist(strsplit(data_imdb$imdb_cast, &quot;[|]&quot;)))) -&gt; unique_actor_count</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>nrow(unique_actor_count) -&gt; unique_actors
head(arrange(unique_actor_count,desc(Freq)),10) -&gt; unique_actor_count_top10

ggplot(data = unique_actor_count_top10, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, fill=color_fill, color = color_bar)+
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = Freq), position=position_dodge(width=1), hjust = -0.5) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ylab(&quot;Number of movies watched featuring actor&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;&quot;) +
  theme_data</code></pre>

<p>It turns out more than 8000 actors have made it to my dataframe and the one I have viewed more than others was Samuel L. Jackson. I’m surprised to see only male actors made it to my top 10. Not sure how that happened…</p>
<div id="average-rating-of-my-most-popular-actors" class="section level3">
<h3>Average rating of my most popular actors</h3>
<p>Next, I want to know if my most popular actors are in highly rated movies. I’ll stick to my top 100 most popular actors and visualise these in a scatterplot. This means I will select the top100 actors, merge them with the dataframe that has all the movies rating data in there and create a scatterplot where I label the points with the actor names using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/index.html">ggrepel package</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;ggrepel&#39;)
head(arrange(unique_actor_count,desc(Freq)),100) -&gt; unique_actor_count_top100
unique_actor_count_top100$Var1 -&gt; actor_group
df_mean_actor &lt;- data.frame()
for(v in actor_group){
  data_imdb %&gt;%
    filter(str_detect(imdb_cast, v)) %&gt;%
    select(myRating) -&gt; df9
  round(mean(df9$myRating),2) -&gt;mean_actor
  df10 &lt;- data.table(&quot;actor&quot; = v, &quot;mean&quot; = mean_actor)
  df_mean_actor&lt;-rbind(df_mean_actor,df10)
}

actor_overview = merge(unique_actor_count_top100, df_mean_actor, by.x=c(&quot;Var1&quot;), by.y=c(&quot;actor&quot;))

ggplot(data = actor_overview, aes(x = mean, y = Freq)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=ifelse(mean&gt;7.5,as.character(Var1),&#39;&#39;)), color = &quot;forestgreen&quot;, box.padding = unit(0.8, &quot;lines&quot;)) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=ifelse(mean&lt;5.8,as.character(Var1),&#39;&#39;)), color = &quot;red&quot;, box.padding = unit(2.2, &quot;lines&quot;)) +

This visualisation gives me some clear insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/">Nicolas Cage</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000230/">Sylvester Stallone</a> movies should be blacklisted for now. I watched several of them, but I rate them poorly</li>
<li>I give <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/">Al Pacino</a> movies high ratings and I have seen a lot of his movies. Safe to watch his other movies too.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323/">Michael Caine</a> is the hidden gem. I have hardly watched his movies, but I loved them. Time to look for some more of his movies!</li>
<li>I haven’t watched many movies with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004755/">Jason Biggs</a> or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829032/">Ray Stevenson</a> and I shouldn’t start any time soon :)</li>
</ul>

<div id="my-favorite-movie-genres" class="section level2">
<h2>My favorite movie genres</h2>
<p>Just like my favorite actors, I can also learn more about favorite genres. The data is setup in the same way, so for now I will go straight to the visualisations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>as.character(data_imdb$imdb_genres) -&gt; data_imdb$imdb_genres
data.frame(table(unlist(strsplit(data_imdb$imdb_genres, &quot;[|]&quot;)))) -&gt; unique_genres_count

filter(unique_genres_count, !grepl(paste(genre_dirt, collapse=&quot;|&quot;), Var1)) -&gt; unique_genres_count
nrow(unique_genres_count)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 22</code></pre>
<p>Just like actors, it is possible for a movie to have multiple genres. I have made them unique and can now see that I only have 22 genres in the dataset.</p>
<p>Let’s see what the average rating is per genre and the number of movies I have watched by genre.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(arrange(unique_genres_count,desc(Freq)),10) -&gt; unique_genres_count_top10

unique_genres_count$Var1 -&gt; genre_group

df_mean_genre &lt;- data.frame()
for(v in genre_group){
  data_imdb %&gt;%
    filter(str_detect(imdb_genres, v)) %&gt;%
    select(myRating) -&gt; df7
    round(mean(df7$myRating),2) -&gt;mean_genre
    df8 &lt;- data.table(&quot;genre&quot; = v, &quot;mean&quot; = mean_genre)
    df_mean_genre&lt;-rbind(df_mean_genre,df8)
}

genre_overview = merge(unique_genres_count, df_mean_genre, by.x=c(&quot;Var1&quot;), by.y=c(&quot;genre&quot;))

ggplot(data = genre_overview, aes(x = Var1, y = mean, fill = Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+
  geom_text(aes(label = mean), size = 3, position=position_dodge(width=1), vjust = -1) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),breaks = seq(0, 10, 1), limits = c(0,8)) +  
  ylab(&quot;Average rating&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;Genre&quot;) +
  theme_data +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-10-07-visualize-and-analyse-imdb-ratings-with-r-part-2_files/figure-html/genre_rating-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I really enjoy a great animation movie (brings out the child in me), but I hardly watch them. Horror is not my preferred genre and that shows in the number of horror movies I have seen and how I rate them.</p>
