<h1>Meet the digital me</h1>
<p>This is likely the most self-centered blogpost you will read today, maybe even this year. Because this post is all about me, the digital me.</p>
<p>Just like all people these days, I leave a digital footprint. I use apps, digital services and websites to share my experiences with others, keep people posted of what I do and compare what I do with all the stuff other people do.</p>
<p>This type of digital behaviour leaves a pretty big digital footprint, with copious amounts of data. Data that I can analyse and visualise to get to know me a little better.</p>
<div id="r-progamming-language-as-a-tool-to-analyse-me" class="section level2">
<h2>R progamming language as a tool to analyse me</h2>
<p>I have decided to collect, analyse and visualise digital data to get to know myself a bit better and practise my analytics skills. For all of the analysis and visualisation I will be using R as a language. In case you don’t know what R is or what you can do with this, I recommend doing a little <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?q=what+is+r+stats+&amp;oq=what+is+r+stats">Google Search</a> and join the <a href="http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/">thousands of R users</a> already working with this language. For all analysts, I believe knowing at least a bit about R stats should be required.</p>

<div id="how-will-i-get-my-data" class="section level2">
<h2>How will I get my data?</h2>
<p>I will be using some pretty cool API’s to pull in data and also do some webscraping to get publicly available data to analyse. Some API’s are already available through <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide">R packages</a> for me to leverage. This will make it pretty easy to get a clean dataset to work with. For webscraping I will use another R package called <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf">Rvest</a>.</p>

<div id="how-will-i-visualise-my-data" class="section level2">
<h2>How will I visualise my data?</h2>
<p>To visualise the digital me, I will also use R packages. <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> and <a href="https://plot.ly/ggplot2/">Plotly</a> to start with, but I may experiment with some additional packages while I’m progressing the journey of getting to know the digital me.</p>

<div id="which-part-of-me-will-i-explore" class="section level2">
<h2>Which part of me will I explore?</h2>
<p>I will analyse myself by looking at the following services I often use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> (I’m a cycling fan and use this to monitor my progress)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> (because I rate movies after watching them)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> (my virtual bookshelf)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> (people’s favorite digital jukebox)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> (my chatter and babbles with others)</li>
</ul>
